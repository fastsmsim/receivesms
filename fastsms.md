<h2>What is Online SMS Reception?</h2>
<p>Online SMS reception is a service that allows users to receive text messages (SMS) through an online platform, rather than through a personal mobile phone number.

Users can choose a number, send an SMS to that number, and see the received messages on the platform's website.</p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>The process of receiving SMS online is fairly straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>
